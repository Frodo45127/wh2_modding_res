# Tools & Resources

Every modder needs proper tools, just like every lumberjack needs a swingset. This list does not claim to be a sure-fire solution to every single issue a modder might face, nor an impervious list of perfect programs, designed to cater your every need. This list **does** have a lot of value in it, I believe, and if used correctly, a lot can be achieved.

#### Kaedrin's Mod Manager
