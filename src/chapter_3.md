# Lua \<3

*Lua* is a popular, lightweight, and wildly versatile programming language used in tons of modern video games, for its flexibility and very quick response time. Lua is an interpreted language, which means its code is executed and generated on the fly, as opposed to compiled languages like C or C++ which need to be “translated” - or, well, compiled - into a different file format prior to running. Its usage in the Total War series is pretty wide-spread, and is the guiding force for a lot of fun goodies, from the content of a quest battle to the implementation of the Chaos Invasion. Unlike db entries, which are compiled during the initial loading screen of the game and turned into engine data, and are often very static with very few exceptions, Lua is a dynamic energy within the game, and is the only direct way to access a multitude of game features, background data, and more.

This section seeks to cover a few specifics about Lua, as well as a (hopefully) solid overview of the language in the Total War context.

It should be noted that this tutorial series is focused on Total War: Warhammer II's Lua environment, and there can and will be many differences between the games. Efforts will be made to universal-ize this series, in the future.
