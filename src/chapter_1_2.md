# Tolerant Tables

#### What's a tolerant table?

**A tolerant table is an arbitrarily defined table that will not crash when a *referenced* key is missing in a certain column.** This is particularly relevant when you are overriding new content from another mod and it turned out that you do not need to port two or more tables just to provide background references for those keys. Instead, you need just one table for the value to edit. 

It may also be a trap leading to stuff not working in your own mod while also not crashing to desktop.

## Registry

Here is a list of such tables and streamline overrides. We encourage you all to report any new findings, preferably in alphabetical order. When reporting new tables, please include the date, because we do not know if or when this kind of behavior can abruptly change CA-side, and older dates can be considered suspicious when you have weird crashes after a patch.
