# Tools & Resources

Every modder needs proper tools, just like every lumberjack needs a swingset. This list does not claim to be a sure-fire solution to every single issue a modder might face, nor an impervious list of perfect programs, designed to cater your every need. This list **does** have a lot of value in it, I believe, and if used correctly, a lot can be achieved.

You'll also notice that this section has random housed tutorials in it, that don't fit in any particular place with the larger-scale tutorials. The author and summary of each will be listed and maintained here!

#### Kaedrin's Mod Manager
