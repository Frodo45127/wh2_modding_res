# Devtool Console

Throughout this tutorial series, I will be referencing the "Devtool Console", a mod made by mklabs that allows one to run some Lua code while *in* the game. It's awesome, and I highly recommend it. I'll be suggesting you use it throughout the tutorial series. Do so.

The big thing to note is that, if you want to print stuff out onto the Devtool Console itself, you can replace out(text) with print(text). Likewise, some statements in Lua are too big to fit on one line in the Devtool Console, but you can have a statement span several lines if you'd like, as long as it doesn't involve assignment. If you don't know what I mean, read a couple lessons first and then come back.
