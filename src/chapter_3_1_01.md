# Devtool Console

Throughout this tutorial series, I will be referencing the "Devtool Console", a mod made by mklabs that allows one to run some Lua code while *in* the game. It's awesome, and I highly recommend it. I'll be suggesting you use it throughout the tutorial series. Do so.

[The long and convoluted series of words that you should press on to download and subscribe to the Devtool Console.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1574469690)

The big thing to note is that, if you want to print stuff out onto the Devtool Console itself, you can replace out(text) with devtool_log(text). Likewise, some statements in Lua are too big to fit on one line in the Devtool Console, but you can have a statement span several lines if you'd like, as long as it doesn't involve assignment. If you don't know what I mean, read a couple lessons first and then come back.

# Lua Interpreter

If you'd like to mess with Lua outside of Total War (strongly recommended you do so, to get a grasp of the language's basics as you go through the first few chapters), you can use repl.it. Super nice website, much recommend you do so. Go to [this webpage](https://repl.it/languages) and select "Lua", and get to typing!
