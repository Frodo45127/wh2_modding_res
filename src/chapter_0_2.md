# Converting to Markdown

### Markdown Conversion

This page is intended as a very quick guide on how to convert your tutorial into the language used here, markdown. Markdown is super simple and made to be incredibly simple.


#### Standard Text

These three are the backbone of any good tutorial.

Italics - \*text\*

Bold - \*\*text\*\*

#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are a great way of showing specific code or db stuffs. All you have to do is put a ">" preceding a paragraph.

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> And this is the blockquote's end.

> You can use most markdown elements in a blockquote, but I won't cover the possibilities here.

> You can also make nestled blockquotes.

#### Headings

You can set six different bolded-sizes for headers, for visual distinction. A header is simply a number sign (#) followed by the text that is being head'ed. There can be one number sign, up to six number signs, preceding the text. One number sign is the largest, six the smallest.
